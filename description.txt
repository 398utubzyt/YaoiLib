[h1]What the hell is this!?[/h1]
This is a core dependency library for my Terraria mods. It provides a bunch of helpful functions and properties which allow for neater code and fewer errors.

Long story short: less references to "Main" in my source code.

[h1]Q&A[/h1]
[h3]Q: Does this mod add any new content?[/h3]
A: No, it's a library.
[h3]Q: Why do I have to download this mod?[/h3]
A: Because I said so.
[h3]Q: Why is the name like that?[/h3]
A: I think that's enough Q&A for now.
